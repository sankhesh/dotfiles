# DotFiles

Most of my configuration files in one location. I use [dotbot][dotbot] for
bootstrapping configuration files.

# Installation

After cloning this repository, run `install` to automatically set up the
development environment. Note that the script is idempotent: it can safely be
run multiple times.
